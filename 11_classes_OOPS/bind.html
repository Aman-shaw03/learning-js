    // a problem we are facing that the reference of "this" (in handleclick() ) is the whole button as we are passing through addeventlistener but the reference of "this" outer of handleclick is not there (button ka ref hai par this.server , this.library ka ref nhi "<button>Subcribe Button</button>"), since it has somewhat half reference => .addEventListener("click", this.handleclick)

    // to tackle this problem in React (where we put onclick on the button in body) we use "bind" and "this" is passed through binding it .addEventListener("click", this.handleclick.bind(this))

    // after using "bind" and pass "this" we have now reference to every variable inside react. and we can now use this.server ot this.library. without bind it wont work . reactÂ {library: 'React', server: 'http://localhost:300'} . also it didnt overwrite the old reference of button "<button>Subcribe Button</button>"

    // we cant use "call" since we are not giving a whole New reference (button) => code will break since nothing new object hasnot been called and "handleclick" is already inside the object
    // "bind.html:57 Uncaught ReferenceError: server is not defined
    // at new react (bind.html:57:72)
    // at bind.html:74:17"
